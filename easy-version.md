## Datalouder live test

Thank you for taking our live test.

This test is created to let us know more about your skills on HTML, CSS, Javascript (ReactJS) and your ability to learn under pressure.

**Time allowed: 60 minutes**

You are allowed to use any library, Google for a solution, or even ask an question on stack overflow. We'll observe how you finish a small project in limited time. You are reminded that if you cannot finish everything, choose wisely and finish those you think are the most important.

Should you have anything unclear, our senior engineer(s) will be on live with you during the test and is ready to help you.

Timer: [https://www.timeanddate.com/timer/](https://www.timeanddate.com/timer/).

### Instructions

Observe carefully the demo on [https://codetestdemo.netlify.app/](https://codetestdemo.netlify.app/).

You will be building the Whatsapp-like UI with React as shown in the demo with React JS.

When time is up, show us your demo.

You will be given a base project which the UI part has already built for you, download it from this link.

### Requirements

Data url: [https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json](https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json)

1. Fetch data from the above url when the home page is loaded and replace the template data (do not use local data, if you do, you fail the test immediately)

2. Show only the latest message of each sender and sort the chats by dates in descending order. The data source has more than you need, get the right part of the data and plug in to the existing UI given to you.

3. You only need to modify two files: App.js and ChatList.js.

4. NO NEED to implement click and highlight effects as shown in the demo, no need to modify any UI (you don't have to change any CSS)

5. Implement a CASE INSENSITIVE search on both senders and messages (More description on point 6).

6. Allow user to type one or more than one search keyword on the search bar, filter out the chat items that without the keyword(s) appear in the sender's' name or message, refer to the demo if you don't understand
