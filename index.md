## Datalouder live test

Thank you for taking our live test.

This test is created to let us know more about your skills on HTML, CSS Javascript (ReactJS) and your ability to learn under pressure.

**Time allowed: 90 minutes**

You are allowed to use any library, Google for a solution, or even ask an question on stack overflow. We'll observe how you finish a small project in limited time. You are reminded that if you cannot finish everything, choose wisely and finish those you think are the most important.

Should you have anything unclear, our senior engineer(s) will be on live with you during the test and is ready to help you.

### Instructions

Observe carefully the demo on ![Alt Text](https://codetestdemo.netlify.app/).

You will be building the Whatsapp-like UI with React as shown in the demo.

You can choose to use Javascript / Typescript. You'll receive bonus points if you finish with Typescript. We suggest you to start with a create-react-app template.

- Javascript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
- Typescript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)

When time is up, show us your demo.

Upon submission, please also exclude the node_modules folder (removal), zip all your codes, and send to us through Whatsapp / Signal.

### Resources provided

1. Data url: [https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json](https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json)

### Key requirements (UI: 50%, Search: 50%)

1. Fetch data from the required url (do not use local data, if you do, you fail the test immediately)

2. Show only the latest message of each sender and sort the chats by dates in descending order. The data source has more than you need, get the right part of the data and show them with a correct UI.

3. Implement the UI, hover and click effects as similar as possible to the DEMO (but no need to be exactly the same). The more similar your work is, the more you can impress us.

4. Implement a case insensitive search on both senders and messages, refer to the demo if you don't understand

5. You must implement the search feature, if you cannot, you fail the test immediately. Balance the time between UI and the search feature.
