## Datalouder live test

Thank you for taking our live test.

This test is created to let us know more about your skills on HTML, CSS Javascript (ReactJS) and your ability to learn.

**Time allowed: 90 minutes**

You are allowed to use any library, Google for a solution, or even ask an question on stack overflow. However, you're not allowed to ask for help from your mentor / person you know, you must finish on your own.

Should you have anything unclear, our senior engineer(s) will be on live with you during the test and is ready to help you.

### Instructions

You will be building a workable Whatsapp-like UI with React as shown in the image and the gif below. Fetch the data from the provided url and map them with a user interface.

You can choose to use Javascript / Typescript. You'll receive bonus points if you finish with Typescript. We suggest you to start with a create-react-app template.
Javascript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
Typescript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)

Upon submission, please exclude the node_modules folder (removal), zip all your codes, and send to us through zoom.

From the work you have submitted, we will judge your code in the following aspects:

- Completeness
- Correctness
- Performance of your algorithm
- Code clarity (e.g. indentations, naming conventions, consistencies, coherence, etc)

You are reminded that to balance the time used on both UI and search feature because their weights are equally distributed (UI: 50%, Search feature: 50%)

### Some key points to address

1. The data are in this url: [https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json](https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json)

2. The data source has more than you need, get the right part of the data and show them with a correct UI

3. When showing the list of chats, show only the latest message under the sender's name

4. For the colors, font, font size and font styles, you don't have to use the same color code as shown in the demo, but need to be very similar, here are some examples but not all of them:

- the sender's name should be in bold
- the message font color should be in light grey
- the date should have smaller font size than the name
- should apply hover effects and the click effects
- long text should be chopped and ends with a dot dot dot

5. The avatar placeholder image is in this url: [https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/avatar_placeholder.png](https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/avatar_placeholder.png)

6. For the search feature, we expect you to do it exactly the same as what you see in the demo, observe the GIF carefully to see how it behaves

### Bonus

We will be impressed if you can do the followings:

1. Use typescript

2. When displaying the list, sort the chats by the descending order, according to the date of it's latest chat
