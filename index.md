## Datalouder live test

Thank you for taking our live test.

This test is created to let us know more about your skills on HTML, CSS, Javascript (ReactJS) and your ability to learn under pressure.

**Time allowed: 90 minutes**

Get any help if necessary because we only care about the output.

If you copied the code from somewhere, make sure your code is clean and leave NOTHING unnecessary.

If you cannot finish everything, choose wisely and finish those you think are the most important.

Should you have anything unclear, our senior engineer(s) will be on live with you during the test and is ready to help you.

### Instructions

Observe carefully the demo on [https://codetestdemo.netlify.app/](https://codetestdemo.netlify.app/).

Building the Whatsapp-like UI with React as shown in the demo.

Use Javascript / Typescript (You'll receive bonus points).

We suggest you to start with a create-react-app template.

- Javascript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
- Typescript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)

When time is up, show us your workable demo.

Upon submission, please also exclude the node_modules folder (removal), zip all your codes, and send to us through Whatsapp / Signal.

### Resources provided

1. Data url: [https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json](https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json)

### Key requirements (UI: 50%, Search: 50%)

1. Fetch data from the required url (DO NOT use local data, if you do, you FAIL IMMEDIATELY)

2. Show only the latest message of each sender and sort the chats by dates in descending order. The data source has more than you need, get the right part of the data and show them with a correct UI.

3. Implement the UI, hover and click effects as similar as possible to the DEMO (but no need to be exactly the same). The more similar your work is, the more you can impress us.

4. Implement a case insensitive search on both senders and messages, refer to the demo if you don't understand

5. You MUST implement the search feature, if you cannot, you FAIL IMMEDIATELY. Balance the time between UI and the search feature.
