## Question 1

```
// given two array(s), a and b, both sorted,
// make a new array c, with all elements in a & b, and still sorted
const a = [1, 3, 5];
const b = [2, 4, 5, 6];
// describe what happens here
const result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6];
```

## Question 2

```
// Question 2:
// given an array, find the most popular element (there is no draw)
const array = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4];
// describe what happens here
const result = 2;
```
