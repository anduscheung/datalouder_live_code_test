## Datalouder take home test

Thank you for taking our take home test.

This test is created to let us know more about your skills on HTML, CSS, Javascript (ReactJS).

### Instructions

Observe carefully the demo on [https://codetestdemo.netlify.app/](https://codetestdemo.netlify.app/).

Build whatever you see in this feature with ReactJS (React Hooks), without using library. Remember to implement click and hover effects, but the highlight effects not needed

You should start with a create-react-app template by your own (in Javascript or Typescript). You'll receive bonus points if you finish with Typescript.

- Javascript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
- Typescript: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)

Upon submission, please delete the node_modules folder (removal), zip you root folder, and upload to our Google Drive:

### Requirements

Data url: [https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json](https://anduscheung.github.io/datalouder_live_code_test/data.json)

1. Fetch data from the above url when the home page is loaded and replace the template data (do not use local data, if you do, you fail the test immediately). The data source has more than you need, get the right part of the data and plug in to the existing UI given to you.

2. Show only the latest message of each sender and sort the chats by dates in descending order (no date library allowed, only pure Javascript Date).

3. For the UI, use pure CSS file (no CSS framework allowed, like tailwindCSS) to style everything

4. Implement a CASE INSENSITIVE search feature on both senders and messages with PURE JAVASCRIPT (no library allowed). i.e. Allow user to type one or more than one search keyword on the search bar, filter out the chat items that without the keyword(s) appear in the sender's' name or message, refer to the demo if you don't understand

5. Remove all unnecessary code upon submission
